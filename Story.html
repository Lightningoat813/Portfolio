  <h2>My story titled "Dust Falling"</h2>
  <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Verne was carefully and quietly walking through the small forest behind the building, hoping to not get caught. When he heard the bell strike 13 times he was puzzled, but he kept going. Soon he was at the back door of the building. It was unlocked, which he also thought was weird considering the building was holding many valuable things. He slowly opened the door, becoming very annoyed that it was creaking so loudly. Once he was inside, he moved as fast as he could without making any noise. Verne was soon upon the room he had come here for. Verne looked around to make sure no one was following him. He then entered the room, careful to not disturb any of the other precious items. Then Verne saw the thing he was looking for. 
    An amethyst crystal. Verne snatched it and ran out as fast as he could and thought he was in the clear until he heard a booming voice say “Where do you think you're going?” He stops in his tracks and turns around and doesn’t see anything. He starts running and again the voice says “Where do you think you're going?”. Verne is now extremely scared and shouts “Who are you?”. He runs home and immediately puts his new found gem in an ostentatious display case. Verne sets his rucksack down and goes into the kitchen. His small house feels even less safe than it was before. He was about to get some leisure time when he heard a large crash. He goes back into the kitchen to find a plate had fallen on the floor. He found that odd and meticulously cleaned it up. 
    After that he made himself dinner with the sparse ingredients he still had. The taste of his cooking was insufferable, but he made a decision in his mind that living is more important than how food tastes.

  <h2>My essay on Should the school week be four days or five?</h2>


<p>Have you ever wanted a 4-day school week? Some schools are thinking about doing just that. Most kids would love to have one less day of school. The change to a 4-day week would not mean less time in school. You would still have to go the same amount of time, only in 4 days, instead of 5. If the school board passes a four day school week in my county, it would be beneficial because it would mean better prepared students and better schools and teachers. <br><br>

A switch to a four day school week would benefit kids in many ways. One reason is that it makes students do better in school and it is popular with the community. In Missouri, the four day school week is already being implemented. A county in Missouri, Clinton County, says that the 4-day week is already improving standardized test scores. The four-day week is also popular with parents. A poll was done in Miami R-1, another county in Missouri,that said that more than 70% of parents supported the change.  This proves that the switch to a four day school week would help students, and it is popular with parents. However, there is the concern of childcare. In Missouri, this turned out to be a bigger problem than they expected. Many parents ended up leaving their children at the school, and the librarian at one school said she had to limit the time people could spend in the library to 2 hours because parents were leaving their children in it for the entire day. This may be a problem, but with the money being saved by having this day off, school districts could use it to fund child care and eliminate that problem.<br><br>  

The switch to a 4-day school week doesn’t just benefit students. According to the superintendent of Miami-R1, Frank Dahman, this switch helps the teachers too.  According to him, “Better-prepared teachers means better students, and that’s where the rubber meets the road.” He believes that an extra day would help teachers get more energy. Some teachers have said that an extra day helps them create better lessons. It also helps them interact with kids better, as they are better rested. Teachers in Missouri are saying they approve of the change, and for the above reasons. <br><br>


One other reason some schools are making the switch is for financial reasons. Having a day where kids don’t come to school saves schools’ money. However the savings are less than they were projected to be, schools can still save a decent amount of money. This would most likely help rural schools, who are in counties who don’t have enough money to fund the schools. This could help rural schools become equal to their suburban counterparts. It could also make schools a better place, since they have more money to spend on important things. <br><br>






The switch to a four-day school week, although not perfect, would benefit everyone and is worth changing to. It helps students by giving them a rest day, it helps teachers because they have more time to create lessons and are better rested. It also saves schools money, which could help them become better. Like John Dewey, the prominent philosopher said,“If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.” We must change to a 4 day week.

  <h2>My poem on The weather</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Underneath the deep blue sky<br>
Thinking about the treaty of Versailles
The sun emerges from behind a cloud, warm and bright,<br>
Gently glowing with golden light.<br>
How great is nature's grace?<br>
Destroying it would be such a disgrace<br>
But we heat our planet more and more<br>
And continue to ignore </p>
