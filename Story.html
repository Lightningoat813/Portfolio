  <h2>My story titled "Dust Falling"</h2>
  <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. I was carefully and quietly walking through the small forest behind the building, hoping to not get caught. I readjusted my mask, and checked that there were no leaks. When I heard the bell strike 13 times I was puzzled, but I kept going. Soon I was at the back door of the building. “It’s unlocked?” I said aloud which probably didn’t help my stealthy ambitions. I also thought it was weird considering the building was holding many valuable things. I slowly opened the door, becoming very annoyed that it was creaking so loudly. Once I was inside, I moved as fast as I could without making any noise. I was soon upon the room I had come here for. I looked around to make sure no one was following him. I then entered the room, careful to not disturb any of the other precious items. Then I saw the thing I was looking for. An amethyst crystal. I snatched it and ran out as fast as I could and thought I was in the clear until I heard a booming voice say “Where do you think you're going?” I stopped in my tracks and turned around and didn't see anything. I started running and again the voice said “Where do you think you're going?”. That’s probably not a good sign. I ran home and immediately put my new found gem in an ostentatious display case. I set my rucksack down and went into the kitchen. My small house felt even less safe than it had before. I was about to get some leisure time when I heard a large crash. I went back into the kitchen to find a plate had fallen on the floor. I found that odd and meticulously cleaned it up. After that I made myself dinner with the sparse ingredients I still had. The taste of my cooking was insufferable, but I made a decision in my mind that living is more important than how food tastes.


    The next day I was walking around trying to wake up like I usually do. I turned a corner and saw someone up the street. This part of the city is pretty uninhabited so whenever you see someone you know it can’t be good. Their mask was failing and they were hacking and coughing. Normally I wouldn’t bat an eye but for some reason I felt like I needed to help them. I hate caring about stuff. But apparently once you start, you can't just stop. So I walked over and gave them one of my spare masks. They thanked me a lot of times(this is why I don’t normally do things like this) and I continued on my way. I checked my watch and saw the air quality index was around 900. For the record, safe to breath is below 50. I had gotten back to my house and had started making myself gulpenwagon which is just as horrible as it sounds, but it is the only food I have. I was just about to start eating when I heard an explosion. Like I said, for some reason I have started caring about the people in this part of town. Weird.

  <h2>My essay on Should the school week be four days or five?</h2>


<p>Have you ever wanted a 4-day school week? Some schools are thinking about doing just that. Most kids would love to have one less day of school. The change to a 4-day week would not mean less time in school. You would still have to go the same amount of time, only in 4 days, instead of 5. If the school board passes a four day school week in my county, it would be beneficial because it would mean better prepared students and better schools and teachers. <br><br>

A switch to a four day school week would benefit kids in many ways. One reason is that it makes students do better in school and it is popular with the community. In Missouri, the four day school week is already being implemented. A county in Missouri, Clinton County, says that the 4-day week is already improving standardized test scores. The four-day week is also popular with parents. A poll was done in Miami R-1, another county in Missouri,that said that more than 70% of parents supported the change.  This proves that the switch to a four day school week would help students, and it is popular with parents. However, there is the concern of childcare. In Missouri, this turned out to be a bigger problem than they expected. Many parents ended up leaving their children at the school, and the librarian at one school said she had to limit the time people could spend in the library to 2 hours because parents were leaving their children in it for the entire day. This may be a problem, but with the money being saved by having this day off, school districts could use it to fund child care and eliminate that problem.<br><br>  

The switch to a 4-day school week doesn’t just benefit students. According to the superintendent of Miami-R1, Frank Dahman, this switch helps the teachers too.  According to him, “Better-prepared teachers means better students, and that’s where the rubber meets the road.” He believes that an extra day would help teachers get more energy. Some teachers have said that an extra day helps them create better lessons. It also helps them interact with kids better, as they are better rested. Teachers in Missouri are saying they approve of the change, and for the above reasons. <br><br>


One other reason some schools are making the switch is for financial reasons. Having a day where kids don’t come to school saves schools’ money. However the savings are less than they were projected to be, schools can still save a decent amount of money. This would most likely help rural schools, who are in counties who don’t have enough money to fund the schools. This could help rural schools become equal to their suburban counterparts. It could also make schools a better place, since they have more money to spend on important things. <br><br>






The switch to a four-day school week, although not perfect, would benefit everyone and is worth changing to. It helps students by giving them a rest day, it helps teachers because they have more time to create lessons and are better rested. It also saves schools money, which could help them become better. Like John Dewey, the prominent philosopher said,“If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.” We must change to a 4 day week.

  <h2>My poem on The weather</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Underneath the deep blue sky<br>
Thinking about the treaty of Versailles<br>
The sun emerges from behind a cloud, warm and bright,<br>
Gently glowing with golden light.<br>
How great is nature's grace?<br>
Destroying it would be such a disgrace<br>
But we heat our planet more and more<br>
And continue to ignore </p>
